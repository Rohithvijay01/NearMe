    Kulamavu Dam is a gravity/masonry dam on Kilivillithode which is a tributary of the Periyar river in Arakkulam village, Idukki district of Kerala, India . It is one of the three dams associated with the Idukki hydro electric power project in the Indian state of Kerala.[1] This dam is located towards the western side of the Idukki Arch Dam.[2] This is a gravity dam with the top portion in concrete and the bottom in masonry.[3]

The dam is situated on the Thodupuzha - Puliyanmala state highway (SH-33), about 23 km (14 mi) from Idukki arch dam, 22 km (14 mi) from Cheruthoni dam and 38 km (24 mi) from Thodupuzha. Preliminary work on the dam was initiated under the leadership of Superintending Engineer, E.U. Philipose. The dam was completed in the year 1977 and is operated and maintained by Kerala State Electricity Board.

The dams of Idukki, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu extend to an area of 33 km2. The construction of these three dams formed a 60 km2 artificial lake. The water stored in it is used for the production of electricity at the power house in Moolamattom.[4][5] Taluks through which release flow are Thodupuzha, Udupanchola, Devikulam, Kothamangalam, Muvattupuzha, Kunnathunadu, Aluva, Kodungalloor and Paravur.
